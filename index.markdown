This is a Python project for the book [**Statistical Analysis of Network Data: Methods
and Models**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-88146-1).

This project records my network learning history using Python. An awesome
project based on **R** about this book can be found
[here](https://github.com/kolaczyk/sand).

Most data and examples comes from [**Statistical Analysis of Network Data with
R**](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781493909834#otherversion=9781493909827).
